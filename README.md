# Breast_Cancer_Predict_XGBoost_SHAP
Predictive modelling of breast cancer

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!!

# Introduction
In this project, a predictive model was constructed using XGBoost to predict a patient has breast cancer. Then, SHAP will be used to explain the model and identify the highly influential features.

## Dataset Information
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic). The features were computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
