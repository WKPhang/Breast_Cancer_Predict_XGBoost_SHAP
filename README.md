# Breast_Cancer_Predict_XGBoost_SHAP
Predictive modelling of breast cancer

# Introduction
In this project, a predictive model was constructed using XGBoost to predict a patient has breast cancer. Then, SHAP will be used to explain the model and identify the highly influential features.

## Dataset Information
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle's Telco Customer Churn Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
